  A frame from the Matrix movie just after Neo (Keanu Reaves) comes back out of
  the Kung Fu training simulation.  Well, and the flag for this challenge, of
  course.

  A good CTF challenge strikes a fine balance between the real and the imagined;
  it should demonstrate or teach some technique or concept related to the Real
  World^TM while cutting away all the tediousness and cruft so as to be fun to
  solve.  Alas this challenge meets none of those criteria.  It is pure
  tediousness and no fun (which makes Jack a dull boy), and so far removed from
  any sane version of realism that I feel compelled to explain, to defend even,
  myself.  When I got the idea for this challenge, I was wondering exactly how
  much structure, redundancy, there is your regular PNG file.  Would it be
  possible to reconstruct it after byte-substitution with a completely random
  key? After about a week's work I think of myself as a somewhat credible source
  when I say 'Hell no, not in a million years!'.  So I started adding things to
  the file, so that you would have more to work with, to guess at, in this
  Pandora's Sudoku.  It was not enough.  If you're reading this, then you know
  about the S-box.  This challenge was doomed from the start, dead for while
  before I dared to realize it.  The S-box (and the 'helpful' removal of
  fix-points) is my attempt at re-animating this lifeless animal.  It is the
  spark of Frankenstein.  I am truly sorry, and you have my sympathies, if
  nothing else.
